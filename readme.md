## Requirements
- Install Docker >= 18.06.1-ce
- Install Docker compose >= 1.22.0

Before anything, you need to make sure you have Docker properly setup in your environment. For that, refer to the official documentation for both Docker and Docker Compose.

## Usage
You are up and running in three simple steps:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/xuansonitvn/env-develop.git env_develop
$ cd env_develop
$ bash/setup.sh
```

#### Nginx
- Create config nginx in folder **nginx/conf.d** with name **example.conf**

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  example.local;
    root /var/www;
    
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    #
    # change filename if use PHP version other 
    # php5.conf or php71.conf or php72.conf
    #
    include php71.conf;
}
```

#### add Host
